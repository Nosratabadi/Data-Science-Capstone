        <h2>1. Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Marketing campaigns are a significant investment for many businesses. Measuring the effectiveness of these campaigns and optimizing them for maximum ROI is critical.  This involves understanding which customers are most likely to respond to a campaign, what types of messages resonate best, and which channels are the most effective.</p>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> The aim of this project is to analyze data from a marketing campaign and build a model to predict which customers are most likely to respond (e.g., make a purchase, click a link, sign up for a newsletter).  This allows the company to target its marketing efforts more efficiently, reducing costs and increasing revenue.  We will focus on binary outcome, purchase or no purchase.</p>

        <h2>2. Data Description</h2>
        <p>This dataset contains information about customers and their responses to a marketing campaign.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rows:</strong> ~4,000 - 40,000 (depending on the dataset)</li>
            <li><strong>Columns:</strong> 15-20 (depending on the dataset)</li>
            <li><strong>Variables:</strong> (This will vary based on the specific dataset – adjust as needed. This example uses variables from the Bank Marketing Dataset.)
                <ul>
                    <li><code>age</code>: Customer's age (numeric).</li>
                    <li><code>job</code>: Type of job (categorical: "admin.","unknown","unemployed","management","housemaid","entrepreneur","student","blue-collar","self-employed","retired","technician","services").</li>
                    <li><code>marital</code>: Marital status (categorical: "married","divorced","single"; note: "divorced" means divorced or widowed).</li>
                    <li><code>education</code>: Education level (categorical: "unknown","secondary","primary","tertiary").</li>
                    <li><code>default</code>: Has credit in default? (binary: "yes","no").</li>
                    <li><code>balance</code>: Average yearly balance, in euros (numeric).</li>
                    <li><code>housing</code>: Has housing loan? (binary: "yes","no").</li>
                    <li><code>loan</code>: Has personal loan? (binary: "yes","no").</li>
                    <li><code>contact</code>: Contact communication type (categorical: "unknown","telephone","cellular").</li>
                    <li><code>day</code>: Last contact day of the month (numeric).</li>
                    <li><code>month</code>: Last contact month of year (categorical: "jan", "feb", "mar", ..., "nov", "dec").</li>
                    <li><code>duration</code>: Last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.</li>
                    <li><code>campaign</code>: Number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact).</li>
                    <li><code>pdays</code>: Number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted).</li>
                    <li><code>previous</code>: Number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric).</li>
                    <li><code>poutcome</code>: Outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: "unknown","other","failure","success").</li>
                    <li><code>y</code>: Has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: "yes","no"). <strong>This is your target variable.</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Your Task</h2>
        <p>Your task is to build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will respond to the marketing campaign.</p>
